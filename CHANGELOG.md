## 2025-10-30 - Proactive Execution Loop Implementation Complete

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Lifecycle (Week 3) ✅ COMPLETE

### Added

**Proactive Execution Loop - The "Heartbeat" of Autonomous Operation:**

- **docs/design/proactive-loop.md** (~1000 lines) - Comprehensive design document
  - Architecture overview with BDI integration
  - Four main phases: Perceive, Reason, Execute, Learn
  - Detailed algorithms for each phase
  - Decision logic (when to replan, when to reflect)
  - Performance considerations and optimization strategies
  - Comprehensive testing strategy
  - Error handling and recovery patterns

- **empla/core/loop/execution.py** (580+ lines) - ProactiveExecutionLoop implementation
  - Main continuous operation loop
  - Protocol-based interfaces for BDI components (allows independent testing)
  - Perceive environment phase (placeholder for Phase 2)
  - Strategic reasoning cycle with decision logic
  - Intention execution delegation
  - Reflection and learning cycles
  - Production-ready error handling (loop never crashes)
  - Comprehensive logging at each step

- **empla/core/loop/models.py** (200+ lines) - Loop-specific models
  - `Observation` - Single observation from environment
  - `PerceptionResult` - Result of perception cycle
  - `IntentionResult` - Result of intention execution
  - `LoopConfig` - Loop configuration (timing, sources, limits)
  - `ROLE_CONFIGS` - Role-specific loop configurations (Sales AE, CSM, PM, etc.)

- **tests/unit/test_proactive_loop.py** (500+ lines) - Comprehensive unit tests
  - 23 tests covering all aspects of loop operation
  - Mock implementations of BDI components
  - Tests for initialization, perception, strategic planning logic
  - Tests for deep reflection logic, intention execution
  - Tests for loop lifecycle (start/stop), cycle execution
  - Tests for error handling (loop continues after errors)
  - Tests for configuration (custom and default)

### Decided

**Architecture Decisions:**

- **Protocol-based interfaces**: Use Python protocols for BDI components
  - Rationale: Allows loop and BDI components to be implemented/tested independently
  - Benefits: Clean separation of concerns, easier testing, flexible implementation

- **Placeholder implementations**: Core loop structure complete, actual implementations in Phase 2
  - Rationale: Allows testing of loop logic before capabilities are implemented
  - Current: Perception returns empty observations, planning/execution are placeholders
  - Next: Phase 2 will add actual perception sources and capability execution

- **Loop decision logic**: When to run strategic planning and deep reflection
  - Strategic planning: Never run before, scheduled interval (24h), or significant belief changes
  - Deep reflection: Never run before or scheduled interval (24h)
  - Rationale: Balance autonomy with computational cost (LLM calls are expensive)

- **Error handling philosophy**: Loop must never crash
  - All errors caught and logged
  - Loop continues after errors with exponential backoff
  - Rationale: Critical for production reliability - employee should keep working

### Test Results

**Unit Tests:**
- **23/23 tests passing** (100% pass rate) ✅
- **Test coverage:** 90.60% on execution.py
- **Test execution time:** 11.45 seconds

**Test categories:**
- Initialization: 1/1 passing
- Perception: 2/2 passing
- Strategic planning logic: 5/5 passing
- Deep reflection logic: 3/3 passing
- Intention execution: 3/3 passing
- Reflection: 1/1 passing
- Loop lifecycle: 3/3 passing
- Loop cycle execution: 2/2 passing
- Strategic planning integration: 1/1 passing
- Configuration: 2/2 passing

### Performance

**Loop characteristics:**
- **Default cycle interval:** 5 minutes (configurable per role)
- **Perception phase:** < 30 seconds (async I/O)
- **Strategic planning:** 0-60 seconds (only when triggered, expensive)
- **Intention execution:** 60-240 seconds (actual work, variable)
- **Learning:** 5-10 seconds (DB writes)

**Role-specific configurations:**
- **Sales AE:** 5 min cycle (highly reactive)
- **CSM:** 10 min cycle (less urgent)
- **PM:** 15 min cycle (strategic work)

### Next

**Phase 2: Basic Capabilities (Next Focus):**
- Implement actual perception sources:
  - Email monitoring (Microsoft Graph/Gmail)
  - Calendar event checking
  - Metric threshold monitoring
  - Time-based triggers
- Implement capability handlers for intention execution
- Implement event monitoring system
- Create E2E test: Employee runs autonomously for 1 hour

**Known TODOs in code:**
- Actual perception sources (Phase 2)
- Full strategic planning with LLM (Phase 2)
- Actual capability execution (Phase 2)
- Full reflection with memory updates (Phase 4)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus integration)

## 2025-10-26 - Phase 0 Complete: Documentation & Project Setup

**Phase:** 0 - Foundation Setup ✅ COMPLETE

### Clarified

**empla's Hybrid Model - Product + Platform:**
- **Previous description:** "Operating System for Autonomous Digital Employees"
- **New description:** "Production-Ready Digital Employees + Extensible Platform to Build Your Own"
- **Rationale:** Clarifies that empla provides BOTH:
  1. Production-ready employees you can deploy immediately (Sales AE, CSM, PM, etc.)
  2. Extensible platform to customize existing employees or build completely new ones
- **Hybrid model:** Primary value = ready-made employees, Secondary value = customization/extension
- **Updated in:** CLAUDE.md, README.md, core mission sections

### Added

**Phase 0 Setup:**
- **pyproject.toml** - Modern Python project configuration
  - Using `uv` for 10-100x faster package management
  - Configured ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage
  - Top-level `empla/` package (not `src/empla/`)
  - Apache 2.0 license

- **docs/guides/project-structure.md** - Official project structure reference
  - Research-backed: Analyzed 8 successful OSS projects (Django, FastAPI, MLflow, PostHog, Prefect, Airflow, Langflow, Supabase)
  - **Decision:** Top-level `empla/` package + separate `web/` UI directory
  - **Rationale:** Follows Python best practices (MLflow, PostHog pattern)
  - Imports: `from empla.core.bdi import BeliefSystem` (simple, clean)
  - Web UI gets own top-level directory with independent tooling
  - Create-as-needed philosophy (directories per phase, not speculative)

- **CLAUDE.md** (1,536 lines, optimized from 1,816) - Complete development guide for Claude Code
  - Working memory system with session management protocol
  - 10-point mandate for proactive, bold, excellent development
  - Meta-loop section establishing Claude Code as first empla employee
  - Complete development workflow (UNDERSTAND → DESIGN → IMPLEMENT → VALIDATE → REVIEW → SUBMIT → ITERATE → MERGE → DOCUMENT → LEARN)
  - **Optimization:** Reduced by 321 lines (18%) while preserving ALL critical teaching examples and workflows

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** (2,091 lines) - Complete technical specification
  - 8-layer architecture (Layers 0-7)

  - Core innovations (BDI, memory, lifecycle, learning, collaboration)
  - Quick-start guide (placeholder)

- **TODO.md** - Session-based work tracker
  - Current session goals
  - Phase 0 task breakdown

- **docs/resources.md** - Learning resources
  - BDI architecture, agent systems, knowledge graphs
  - RAG systems, WebRTC, imitation learning
  - Multi-agent protocols, vector databases
  - Python/FastAPI, security, observability

### Decided

**Technology Stack (Locked):**
- **ADR-001** (to be written): PostgreSQL 17 as primary database
  - Rationale: Production-proven, handles relational + JSONB + pgvector + full-text search + row-level security
  - Alternatives considered: MongoDB, Neo4j, specialized DBs
  - Decision: Start PostgreSQL-first, migrate only if proven necessary

- **ADR-002** (to be written): Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
  - Rationale: Async-native, type hints, modern features, excellent ecosystem
  - Alternatives considered: Go, Rust, Node.js
  - Decision: Python for AI/ML integration, FastAPI for async web framework

- **ADR-003** (to be written): Custom BDI architecture over agent frameworks
  - Rationale: empla's autonomy requirements differ from existing frameworks
  - Alternatives considered: LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Agno
  - Decision: Build custom BDI, evaluate frameworks for tool execution in Phase 2

- **ADR-004** (to be written): Defer agent framework decision to Phase 2
  - Rationale: Don't know tool execution needs yet, avoid premature lock-in
  - Alternatives considered: Lock in Agno now
  - Decision: Implement core autonomy first, choose framework based on real needs

- **ADR-005** (to be written): Use pgvector for initial vector storage
  - Rationale: Simpler operations, handles millions of vectors, PostgreSQL already deployed
  - Alternatives considered: Qdrant, Weaviate, Pinecone
  - Decision: Start with pgvector, migrate to dedicated vector DB only if proven necessary

- **ADR-006** (to be written): Proactive loop over event-driven architecture
  - Rationale: Employees need to "think" even when no events occur, simpler to reason about
  - Alternatives considered: Full event-driven with message queues
  - Decision: Polling loop (5 min default), separate fast-path for urgent events

**Development Philosophy:**
- Lock minimal stable infrastructure
- Defer framework decisions until implementation proves need
- Build production-quality from day 1
- Test-driven development (>80% coverage target)
- Documentation-driven development (ADRs before decisions, design docs before features)

### Discovered

**Documentation Issues (from comprehensive review):**
- ✅ CLAUDE.md too large (1,816 lines) → **FIXED:** Optimized to 1,495 lines
- 800+ lines of redundant content across files → **PARTIALLY FIXED:** Removed ~140 lines by pointing to ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ Missing operational files → **FIXED:** Created ADR/design doc templates, resources.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md too large (2,091 lines) → **DEFERRED:** Will address if needed

**Optimization Strategy Applied:**
1. ✅ Created ADR infrastructure (docs/decisions/ with template)
2. ✅ Created design doc infrastructure (docs/design/ with template)
3. ✅ Created docs/resources.md (moved learning resources from CLAUDE.md)
4. ✅ Optimized CLAUDE.md - reduced by 321 lines (18%) to 1,495 lines
5. ✅ Preserved ALL critical teaching examples and workflows
6. ⏳ Write 6 initial ADRs (next task)

### Next

**Immediate (Phase 0 completion):**
- ✅ Create docs/decisions/ directory with ADR template
- ✅ Create docs/design/ directory with design template
- ⏳ Write initial ADRs (001-006) for documented decisions

  - empla/utils/ (utilities)
- Created tests/ structure:
  - tests/{unit,integration,e2e}/ (test organization)

### Decided

**Design Decisions Documented:**

- **Belief Decay:** Linear decay for simplicity (revisit exponential in Phase 3)
  - Rationale: Easier to understand, debug, and tune
  - Decay rates: observation (0.05/day), told_by_human (0.03/day), inference (0.1/day), prior (0.15/day)

- **Vector Dimensions:** 1024-dimensional embeddings
  - Rationale: Balance between quality and performance
  - Can upgrade to 1536 or 3072 if quality issues emerge

- **Memory Capacity:** Soft limits with importance-based eviction
  - Rationale: More flexible than hard limits, adapts to usage patterns
  - Working memory: 20 contexts max, evict lowest priority

- **SPO Triple Structure:** Subject-Predicate-Object for both beliefs and semantic memory
  - Rationale: Standard knowledge representation, query-friendly
  - Enables graph traversal and relationship queries

- **Multi-tenant RLS:** All tables have tenant_id with row-level security
  - Rationale: Security from day 1, prevents cross-tenant data leaks
  - Application sets current_tenant_id, PostgreSQL enforces isolation

### Next

**Immediate (Phase 1 implementation):**
- Implement SQLAlchemy models based on database schema
- Create Alembic migrations for all tables
- Implement BeliefSystem class (empla/core/bdi/beliefs.py)
- Implement GoalSystem class (empla/core/bdi/goals.py)

## 2025-10-30 - Memory Systems Implementation Complete

**Phase:** 1 - Foundation & Lifecycle (Memory Systems)

### Fixed

**Memory System Implementation Bugs:**
- **SemanticMemory.store_fact():**
  - Fixed: Convert dict objects to JSON strings before storing in `object` field
  - Fixed: Model expected string type, but tests passed dicts (e.g., `{"employees": 500}`)
  - Added: `import json` for proper serialization
  - Result: Test `test_semantic_memory_query_by_subject` now passing

- **ProceduralMemory.record_procedure():**
  - Fixed: Added missing `description` field (empty string default)
  - Fixed: JSONB `@>` operator query - replaced `str(trigger_conditions)` with `json.dumps(trigger_conditions)`
  - Fixed: Store `steps` list directly in JSONB (not wrapped in dict with "steps" key)
  - Added: `import json` for proper JSONB parameter handling
  - Result: All 4 ProceduralMemory tests now passing

- **WorkingMemory.refresh_item():**
  - Fixed: Round importance values to avoid floating-point precision errors
  - Issue: `0.7 + 0.1 = 0.7999999999999999` caused test assertion failures
  - Solution: `round(min(1.0, item.importance + importance_boost), 10)`
  - Result: Test `test_working_memory_refresh` now passing

### Test Results

**Memory Integration Tests:**
- **Before fixes:** 7/17 passing (41%)
- **After fixes:** 17/17 passing (100%) ✅
- **Coverage:** 49.40% (up from ~37%)
