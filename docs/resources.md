## üóÑÔ∏è Vector Databases

**Core Concept:** Efficient similarity search for embeddings

**Key Resources:**
- **pgvector Documentation** - https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector

  - Dedicated vector database
  - Migration target if pgvector proves insufficient
- **Weaviate Documentation** - https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate
  - Vector database with built-in vectorization

**Why This Matters for empla:**
- Memory retrieval uses semantic similarity (vector search)
- Start with pgvector (simpler), migrate to Qdrant if needed (>10M vectors)
- Decision deferred until real usage patterns emerge
