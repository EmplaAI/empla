    Base class for all capabilities.

    A capability is a discrete unit of functionality that provides:
    1. **Perception** - observe environment for changes/events
    2. **Action** - execute specific operations with robust retry logic
    3. **State** - maintain capability-specific state

    Capabilities are:
    - **Tenant-scoped** - isolated per customer
    - **Employee-scoped** - per-employee configuration
    - **Observable** - comprehensive logging and metrics
    - **Testable** - mock implementations available
    - **Reliable** - automatic retry for transient failures, PII-safe error logging
