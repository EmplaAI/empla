# empla - Autonomous Digital Employee Operating System
## Complete Technical Architecture v0.1

> Last Updated: 2025-10-25
> Status: Initial Design
> This is a LIVING DOCUMENT - update as we learn and build

---

## 🎯 Vision

**empla** is not an AI agent framework - it's the **Operating System for Autonomous Digital Employees**.

Digital employees built with empla:
- Have **goals** and work toward them proactively
- **Strategize** and plan multi-step workflows autonomously
- Possess **superhuman capabilities** (infinite memory, 24/7 operation, vast knowledge)
- **Participate fully** in work (run meetings, create content, manage relationships)
- Have distinct **personalities** and decision-making styles
- **Learn and improve** continuously from every interaction

Think: "If you could hire a tireless, brilliant employee who never forgets anything and works 24/7 - that's empla."

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Layer 0: Employee Lifecycle Management (The "HR System")

**empla isn't just an agent framework - it's a complete Digital Workforce Platform. Creating a digital employee should mirror hiring a human.**

#### 0.1 Employee Identity & Profile

```python
class EmployeeProfile:
    """Complete employee identity (like HRIS)"""

    # Identity
    employee_id: UUID
    email: str                      # Real email: jordan@company.com
    name: str
    avatar_url: str                 # Profile photo/AI avatar

    # Role & Organization
    job_title: str                  # "Sales Account Executive"
    department: str                 # "Sales", "Customer Success", etc.
    team: str
    manager: Union[Human, DigitalEmployee]  # Can report to human or digital
    start_date: datetime
    employment_status: EmployeeStatus  # onboarding, active, inactive, offboarded

    # Capabilities & Skills
    capabilities: List[Capability]   # Enabled capabilities
    skills: List[Skill]             # Learned skills
    certifications: List[Cert]      # Completed training

    # Access & Permissions
    access_level: AccessLevel       # What systems they can access
    permissions: Dict[str, List[Permission]]
    integrations: List[Integration]  # Connected services

    # Goals & Performance
    goals: Dict[str, Goal]          # Current goals and metrics
    performance_history: List[Review]

    # Metadata
    created_at: datetime
    created_by: User
    last_active: datetime
```

**Employee Provisioning:**
```python
class EmployeeProvisioning:
    """Automated employee setup"""

    async def create_employee(self, config: EmployeeConfig) -> Employee:
        """Complete employee creation like hiring a human"""

        # 1. Create identity
        profile = await self.create_profile(config)

        # 2. Provision email address
        email = await self.provision_email(
            username=config.name.lower().replace(" ", "."),
            domain=config.company_domain
        )
        # jordan@company.com is now a real, working email address

        # 3. Set up calendar
        calendar = await self.provision_calendar(email)

        # 4. Create chat presence (Slack/Teams)
        await self.create_chat_user(
            name=config.name,
            title=config.job_title,
            avatar=config.avatar_url
        )

        # 5. Configure integrations
        for integration in config.integrations:
            await self.setup_integration(employee, integration)

        # 6. Initialize memory systems
        await self.initialize_memory(employee)

        # 7. Set onboarding status
        employee.status = EmployeeStatus.ONBOARDING

        return employee

    async def provision_email(self, username: str, domain: str) -> str:
        """Create real email address via Microsoft Graph/Gmail API"""
        # Creates actual mailbox that can send/receive
        # Other employees (human or digital) can email them
```

#### 0.2 Employee Onboarding System

**Just like onboarding a human, digital employees go through structured learning before working independently.**

```python
class OnboardingPipeline:
    """Multi-phase onboarding process"""

    phases = [
        "shadow_mode",      # Observe humans, don't act

            ]
        )

        # 3. Learn from observations
        await self.learn_from_human(employee, mentor, shadow_config)

    async def learn_from_human(
        self,
        employee: Employee,

        # Observe task execution
        tasks = await self.get_mentor_tasks(mentor, last_n_days=30)
        workflows = await self.extract_workflows(tasks)
        # Learn: how they sequence actions, what they prioritize, when they escalate

        # Observe decision-making (Thought Cloning)
        decisions = await self.get_mentor_decisions(mentor)
        reasoning = await self.extract_reasoning_patterns(decisions)

        # RLHF: Get feedback from mentor
        feedback = await self.get_mentor_feedback(mentor, employee)
        await self.apply_feedback(employee, feedback)
```

**Behavioral Cloning Examples:**

```python

    """Learn email writing style from mentor"""

    async def analyze_email_style(self, emails: List[Email]) -> EmailStyle:

#### 0.3 Learning from Humans (Continuous)

**Beyond onboarding, employees continuously learn from human feedback.**

```python

#### 0.4 Performance Management

```python

### Layer 1: Autonomous Core (The "Brain")

#### 1.1 BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) Engine

The cognitive foundation inspired by human psychology:

**Beliefs System**
```python
class BeliefSystem:

**Intentions System (Committed Plans)**
```python

    pending_intentions: Queue[Intention]     # Queued for execution
