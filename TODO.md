> **Purpose:** Track current session work, priorities, blockers, and insights
> **Updated:** Every session start/end
> **Audience:** Claude Code (for session continuity)

## ðŸ“‹ Current Session: 2025-10-26

### Today's Goal
Complete Phase 0, set up Phase 1 development environment

### Completed âœ…
- [x] Comprehensive documentation review (3 subagents, all thorough)
- [x] CLAUDE.md optimized (1,816 â†’ 1,536 lines, 15% reduction, zero info loss)
- [x] All 6 ADRs written and comprehensive
- [x] Documentation infrastructure complete
- [x] Pre-Phase-1 readiness validated (95% ready, A grade)

### In Progress
- [ ] Create project scaffold (src/empla/, tests/, pyproject.toml)
- [ ] Set up local development environment (uv + native PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Write Phase 1 design documents

### Blockers
- None currently

### Insights & Notes
- Questioned Docker for local dev â†’ Switched to native PostgreSQL (faster, simpler)
- Questioned venv+pip â†’ Switched to uv (10-100x faster, modern)
- Documentation is exceptionally consistent (0 contradictions found)
- Need design docs before implementation (database schema, BDI, memory, models)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase: Phase 0 - Foundation Setup âœ… 100% COMPLETE

**Goal:** Establish documentation infrastructure before Phase 1 implementation

### Phase 0 Tasks - ALL COMPLETE âœ…
- [x] Create TODO.md
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Create docs/decisions/ with ADR template
- [x] Create docs/design/ with design template
- [x] Create docs/README.md explaining doc system
- [x] Write initial ADRs for existing decisions:
  - [x] ADR-001: PostgreSQL as primary database
  - [x] ADR-002: Python + FastAPI stack choice
  - [x] ADR-003: Custom BDI architecture over frameworks
  - [x] ADR-004: Defer agent framework to Phase 2
  - [x] ADR-005: Use pgvector for initial vector storage
  - [x] ADR-006: Proactive loop over event-driven architecture
- [x] Optimize CLAUDE.md (1,536 lines final, comprehensive, zero info loss)
- [x] Comprehensive pre-implementation review (3 subagents)

## ðŸ“… Upcoming Work

### Phase 1: Foundation & Lifecycle (STARTING NOW)

**Week 0: Setup & Design (Days 1-2)**
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with uv-based setup
- [ ] Create project scaffold (src/empla/, tests/)
- [ ] Set up native PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector (not Docker)
- [ ] Create scripts/setup-local-db.sh
- [ ] Create docs/guides/local-development-setup.md
- [ ] Create .gitignore and LICENSE
- [ ] Write design doc: database-schema.md
- [ ] Write design doc: core-models.md
- [ ] Write design doc: bdi-engine.md
- [ ] Write design doc: memory-system.md

**Week 1: Foundation (Days 3-7)**
- [ ] Implement database schema with Alembic migrations
- [ ] Implement core Pydantic models (Employee, Profile, Goal, Belief)
- [ ] Set up FastAPI skeleton with health check
- [ ] Write initial unit tests (models, basic DB)

**Week 2: BDI Engine (Days 8-14)**
- [ ] Implement BeliefSystem (world model, updates, queries)
- [ ] Implement GoalSystem (goal hierarchy, prioritization)
- [ ] Implement IntentionStack (plan commitment, reconsideration)
- [ ] Integration: BDI components working together
- [ ] Comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)

**Week 3: Proactive Loop (Days 15-21)**
- [ ] Implement ProactiveExecutionLoop
- [ ] Implement event monitoring system
- [ ] Integration: BDI + Proactive Loop
- [ ] E2E test: Employee runs autonomously for 1 hour

**Week 4: Memory System (Days 22-28)**
- [ ] Implement episodic memory (record/recall with vectors)
- [ ] Implement semantic memory (knowledge storage)
- [ ] Implement procedural memory (workflow storage)
- [ ] Integration: Memory + BDI
- [ ] E2E test: Employee learns and recalls

### Known Dependencies
- Phase 0 must complete before Phase 1
- All ADRs should be written before architectural implementation
- Design docs should be created for each major component before coding

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for Later

- Create automated ADR/design doc generator (subagent)
- Build context-aware session startup tool
- Create E2E testing framework early (Phase 1)
- Consider using MCP for some utilities

---

## ðŸš§ Known Issues

None currently - fresh start!

---

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

### Documentation Health
- [x] CLAUDE.md created
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md created
- [x] README.md created
- [x] TODO.md created
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created
- [ ] ADR infrastructure created
- [ ] Design doc infrastructure created

### Implementation Progress
- No code written yet (Phase 0: docs first)
- Target: Start Phase 1 after documentation optimization
