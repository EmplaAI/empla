## üìã Current Session: 2025-10-30

### Today's Goal
Fix memory system implementation bugs and achieve 100% test pass rate

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Fixed SemanticMemory.store_fact() - dict to JSON string conversion
- [x] Fixed ProceduralMemory.record_procedure() - JSONB query and steps storage
- [x] Fixed WorkingMemory.refresh_item() - floating-point precision rounding
- [x] All 17 memory integration tests passing (100% pass rate)
- [x] CodeRabbit review completed - 10 issues identified for future work
- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md with comprehensive fix summary
- [x] Pushed all fixes to PR #9

### In Progress
- None - all work completed

### Blockers
- None currently

### Insights & Notes
- Memory system tests revealed 3 key issues: type mismatches, JSONB serialization, float precision
- Test-driven development caught all bugs before production
- Coverage improved from 37% to 49.40% with comprehensive memory tests
- CodeRabbit identified code quality improvements (session.flush consistency, type hints, datetime deprecation)
- Decided to prioritize functionality over code quality issues - address in follow-up PRs

## üéØ Current Phase: Phase 0 - Foundation Setup ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE

**Goal:** Establish documentation infrastructure before Phase 1 implementation

### Phase 0 Tasks - ALL COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- [x] Create TODO.md
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Create docs/decisions/ with ADR template
- [x] Create docs/design/ with design template
- [x] Create docs/README.md explaining doc system
- [x] Write initial ADRs for existing decisions:
  - [x] ADR-001: PostgreSQL as primary database
  - [x] ADR-002: Python + FastAPI stack choice
  - [x] ADR-003: Custom BDI architecture over frameworks
  - [x] ADR-004: Defer agent framework to Phase 2
  - [x] ADR-005: Use pgvector for initial vector storage
  - [x] ADR-006: Proactive loop over event-driven architecture
- [x] Optimize CLAUDE.md (1,536 lines final, comprehensive, zero info loss)
- [x] Comprehensive pre-implementation review (3 subagents)

## üìÖ Upcoming Work

### Phase 1: Foundation & Lifecycle (STARTING NOW)

**Week 0: Setup & Design (Days 1-2)**
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with uv-based setup
- [ ] Create project scaffold (src/empla/, tests/)
- [ ] Set up native PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector (not Docker)
- [ ] Create scripts/setup-local-db.sh
- [ ] Create docs/guides/local-development-setup.md
- [ ] Create .gitignore and LICENSE
- [ ] Write design doc: database-schema.md
- [ ] Write design doc: core-models.md
- [ ] Write design doc: bdi-engine.md
- [ ] Write design doc: memory-system.md

**Week 1: Foundation (Days 3-7)**
- [ ] Implement database schema with Alembic migrations
- [ ] Implement core Pydantic models (Employee, Profile, Goal, Belief)
- [ ] Set up FastAPI skeleton with health check
- [ ] Write initial unit tests (models, basic DB)

**Week 2: BDI Engine (Days 8-14)**
- [ ] Implement BeliefSystem (world model, updates, queries)
- [ ] Implement GoalSystem (goal hierarchy, prioritization)
- [ ] Implement IntentionStack (plan commitment, reconsideration)
- [ ] Integration: BDI components working together
- [ ] Comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)

**Week 3: Proactive Loop (Days 15-21)**
- [ ] Implement ProactiveExecutionLoop
- [ ] Implement event monitoring system
- [ ] Integration: BDI + Proactive Loop
- [ ] E2E test: Employee runs autonomously for 1 hour

**Week 4: Memory System (Days 22-28)** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement episodic memory (record/recall with vectors)
- [x] Implement semantic memory (knowledge storage)
- [x] Implement procedural memory (workflow storage)
- [x] Implement working memory (context management)
- [x] Integration: Memory systems working together
- [x] Comprehensive integration tests (17/17 passing, 100% pass rate)

### Known Dependencies
- Phase 0 must complete before Phase 1
- All ADRs should be written before architectural implementation
- Design docs should be created for each major component before coding

---

## üí° Ideas for Later

- Create automated ADR/design doc generator (subagent)
- Build context-aware session startup tool
- Create E2E testing framework early (Phase 1)
- Consider using MCP for some utilities

---

## üöß Known Issues

None currently - fresh start!

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Documentation Health
- [x] CLAUDE.md created
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md created
- [x] README.md created
- [x] TODO.md created
- [x] CHANGELOG.md created
- [ ] ADR infrastructure created
- [ ] Design doc infrastructure created

### Implementation Progress
**Phase 1 Progress:**
- Week 0 (Setup & Design): ‚úÖ 100% complete
- Week 1 (Foundation): ‚úÖ 100% complete
- Week 2 (BDI Engine): ‚úÖ 100% complete
