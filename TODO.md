# empla - Current Work Tracker

> **Purpose:** Track current session work, priorities, blockers, and insights
> **Updated:** Every session start/end
> **Audience:** Claude Code (for session continuity)

## ðŸ“‹ Current Session: 2025-10-30 (Continued)

### Today's Goal
Implement Proactive Execution Loop - the "heartbeat" of empla's autonomous operation

### Completed âœ…
- [x] Created comprehensive design doc (docs/design/proactive-loop.md, ~1000 lines)
- [x] Implemented ProactiveExecutionLoop core class (empla/core/loop/execution.py)
- [x] Implemented all 4 phases:
  - [x] Perceive environment (observation gathering)
  - [x] Strategic reasoning (deep planning cycle)
  - [x] Intention execution (work execution)
  - [x] Reflection & learning (continuous improvement)
- [x] Created loop models (Observation, PerceptionResult, IntentionResult, LoopConfig)
- [x] Created BDI protocol interfaces for dependency injection
- [x] Implemented loop start/stop lifecycle management
- [x] Added production-ready error handling (loop never crashes)
- [x] Wrote comprehensive unit tests (23 tests, 100% passing)
- [x] Achieved 90.60% test coverage on execution.py

### In Progress
- Updating TODO.md with session progress

### Blockers
- None currently

### Insights & Notes
- Proactive loop is structurally complete with placeholder implementations
- Used protocol-based interfaces to allow independent testing of loop and BDI components
- Loop decision logic (when to replan, when to reflect) is fully implemented
- All timing logic tested (cycle intervals, strategic planning triggers, etc.)
- Error handling ensures loop never crashes (critical for production)
- Ready for Phase 2: Implementing actual perception sources and capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase: Phase 0 - Foundation Setup âœ… 100% COMPLETE

**Goal:** Establish documentation infrastructure before Phase 1 implementation

### Phase 0 Tasks - ALL COMPLETE âœ…
- [x] Create TODO.md
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Create docs/decisions/ with ADR template
- [x] Create docs/design/ with design template
- [x] Create docs/README.md explaining doc system
- [x] Write initial ADRs for existing decisions:
  - [x] ADR-001: PostgreSQL as primary database
  - [x] ADR-002: Python + FastAPI stack choice
  - [x] ADR-003: Custom BDI architecture over frameworks
  - [x] ADR-004: Defer agent framework to Phase 2
  - [x] ADR-005: Use pgvector for initial vector storage
  - [x] ADR-006: Proactive loop over event-driven architecture
- [x] Optimize CLAUDE.md (1,536 lines final, comprehensive, zero info loss)
- [x] Comprehensive pre-implementation review (3 subagents)

## ðŸ“… Upcoming Work

### Phase 1: Foundation & Lifecycle (STARTING NOW)

**Week 0: Setup & Design (Days 1-2)**
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with uv-based setup
- [ ] Create project scaffold (src/empla/, tests/)
- [ ] Set up native PostgreSQL 17 + pgvector (not Docker)
- [ ] Create scripts/setup-local-db.sh
- [ ] Create docs/guides/local-development-setup.md
- [ ] Create .gitignore and LICENSE
- [ ] Write design doc: database-schema.md
- [ ] Write design doc: core-models.md
- [ ] Write design doc: bdi-engine.md
- [ ] Write design doc: memory-system.md

**Week 1: Foundation (Days 3-7)**
- [ ] Implement database schema with Alembic migrations
- [ ] Implement core Pydantic models (Employee, Profile, Goal, Belief)
- [ ] Set up FastAPI skeleton with health check
- [ ] Write initial unit tests (models, basic DB)

**Week 2: BDI Engine (Days 8-14)**
- [ ] Implement BeliefSystem (world model, updates, queries)
- [ ] Implement GoalSystem (goal hierarchy, prioritization)
- [ ] Implement IntentionStack (plan commitment, reconsideration)
- [ ] Integration: BDI components working together
- [ ] Comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)

**Week 3: Proactive Loop (Days 15-21)** âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Implement ProactiveExecutionLoop
- [x] Implement loop models and protocols
- [x] Implement decision logic (when to replan, reflect)
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests (23 tests, 100% passing)
- [x] Achieve 90% test coverage
- [ ] Implement actual perception sources (Phase 2)
- [ ] Implement event monitoring system (Phase 2)
- [ ] E2E test: Employee runs autonomously for 1 hour (Phase 2)

**Week 4: Memory System (Days 22-28)** âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Implement episodic memory (record/recall with vectors)
- [x] Implement semantic memory (knowledge storage)
- [x] Implement procedural memory (workflow storage)
- [x] Implement working memory (context management)
- [x] Integration: Memory systems working together
- [x] Comprehensive integration tests (17/17 passing, 100% pass rate)

### Known Dependencies
- Phase 0 must complete before Phase 1
- All ADRs should be written before architectural implementation
- Design docs should be created for each major component before coding

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for Later

- Create automated ADR/design doc generator (subagent)
- Build context-aware session startup tool
- Create E2E testing framework early (Phase 1)
- Consider using MCP for some utilities

---

## ðŸš§ Known Issues

None currently - fresh start!
