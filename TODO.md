## 📅 Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2.1): BDI + LLM Integration
**Priority:** Integrate LLMService into BDI components for autonomous decision-making

1. ✅ **Belief extraction** - Use LLM to extract structured beliefs from observations (COMPLETE)
   - Location: `empla/bdi/beliefs.py`
   - Status: Implemented with 4 passing tests, 72.13% coverage
   - Features: SPO extraction, evidence tracking, error handling

2. **Plan generation** - Use LLM to generate action plans when no learned strategy exists (NEXT)
   - Location: `empla/core/bdi/intentions.py`
   - Input: Current goals, beliefs, context
   - Output: Step-by-step action plans (Intention objects)

3. **Strategic planning** - Use LLM for deep reasoning and strategy generation (FUTURE)
   - Location: `empla/core/planning/strategic.py` (to be created)
   - Input: Long-term goals, current situation, historical outcomes
   - Output: Strategic plans and approach recommendations

### Future (Phase 2.2): Tool Execution & Capabilities
- Choose agent framework (Agno vs LangGraph vs custom) - **DECISION NEEDED**
- Implement tool execution layer
- Add core capabilities (email, calendar, research)
- Integration testing with real API keys

### Known Dependencies
- Phase 2.1 depends on completed LLM abstraction (✅ done)
- Phase 2.2 depends on agent framework decision (pending)
