> **Updated:** Every session start/end
> **Audience:** Claude Code (for session continuity)

## ðŸ“‹ Current Session: 2025-10-26

### Today's Goal
Complete documentation infrastructure setup and optimization

### In Progress
- [x] Comprehensive documentation review
- [ ] Create foundational documentation files (TODO.md, CHANGELOG.md, ADR templates)
- [ ] Optimize CLAUDE.md for session efficiency
- [ ] Set up ADR and design doc infrastructure

### Blockers
- None currently

### Insights & Notes
- Documentation analysis revealed 800+ lines of redundancy across files
- CLAUDE.md is too large (1,816 lines) - will consume too much context each session
- Need to create session management infrastructure before starting implementation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Phase: Phase 0 - Foundation Setup

**Goal:** Establish documentation infrastructure before Phase 1 implementation

### Phase 0 Tasks
- [x] Create TODO.md
- [x] Create CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Create docs/decisions/ with ADR template
- [x] Create docs/design/ with design template
- [x] Create docs/README.md explaining doc system
- [ ] Write initial ADRs for existing decisions:
  - [ ] ADR-001: Why PostgreSQL as primary database
  - [ ] ADR-002: Python + FastAPI stack choice
  - [ ] ADR-003: BDI architecture decision
  - [ ] ADR-004: Defer agent framework to Phase 2
  - [ ] ADR-005: Use pgvector for initial vector storage
  - [ ] ADR-006: Proactive loop over event-driven architecture
- [ ] Optimize CLAUDE.md (reduce from 1,816 to ~1,000 lines)
- [ ] Consider: Split ARCHITECTURE.md into modular docs (optional)
- [ ] Create session start checklist

---

## ðŸ“… Upcoming Work

### Phase 1: Foundation & Lifecycle (Next after Phase 0)
- [ ] Project structure setup (src/empla/, tests/, etc.)
- [ ] Database setup (PostgreSQL with Docker)
- [ ] Core models (Employee, Profile, etc.)
- [ ] BDI Engine foundation
- [ ] Proactive execution loop
- [ ] Multi-type memory system (basic)

### Known Dependencies
- Phase 0 must complete before Phase 1
- All ADRs should be written before architectural implementation
- Design docs should be created for each major component before coding

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for Later

- Create automated ADR/design doc generator (subagent)
- Build context-aware session startup tool
- Create E2E testing framework early (Phase 1)
- Consider using MCP for some utilities

---

## ðŸš§ Known Issues

None currently - fresh start!

---

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking

### Documentation Health
- [x] CLAUDE.md created
- [x] ARCHITECTURE.md created
- [x] README.md created
- [x] TODO.md created
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created
- [ ] ADR infrastructure created
- [ ] Design doc infrastructure created

### Implementation Progress
- No code written yet (Phase 0: docs first)
- Target: Start Phase 1 after documentation optimization
